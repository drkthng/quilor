# Roy Quilor's new minimal portfolio website made with Jekyll, Sass, Susy via Grunt #

I love simple, clean minimal sites including the code.

Chris Coyier is an inspiration:
* [Grunt is not weird and hard](https://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/)  
* [Tour site progress built jekyll grunt sass svg system](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/screencast-134-tour-site-progress-built-jekyll-grunt-sass-svg-system/)

You'll need two command line tabs open:

1. Type `grunt serve` into one and it'll run the server.
2. Type `grunt` into the second one which will do everything and kick off the watching
3. Go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)
4. Might as well kick on the [LiveReload browser extension](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-)
